So decentralized data security and privacy-first tools are really necessary.

For that reason, Oasis Docs was born.

## Development Guide

### Server

- config your environment variables in `.env`

```sh
OASIS_SERVER_CLIENT_ID='<REPLACE>'
OASIS_API_PRIVATE_KEY='<REPLACE>'
```

- install all dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

- then run server, by default server run at `http://localhost:4000`

```sh
npm run start
```

### Client

- set your backend URL at `src/constant.js`

```js
export const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:4000/';
```

npm install
```

- then start your client, by default client run at `http://localhost:3000`

```sh

```

## Known issues

- I cannot find a way to oauth with Oasis Steward, so app still can not fetch all file, also cannot grant/revoke permission on your own files. At now after upload files, you must go to `https://steward.oasiscloud.io/` to interact with your files.
